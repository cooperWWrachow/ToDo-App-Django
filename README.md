In order to further understand Django, HTML, and CSS, I decided to ditch my daily sticky notes and create a task list app that 
I can use on a daily basis. It may not be the most complicated project, but it aided in my understanding of front-end development alongside Django's backend functionality.
I decided not to deploy it as a full website, but instead created a batch file that runs the "manage.py runserver" command on the startup of my desktop. Below are a few GIFs
that demonstrate its functionality!

First, I wanted to show its login/logout/user registration functionality. While, I am the only person using the app, I still wanted to develop an appealing login and user registration page.
The first GIF shows the login form, while the second shows the registration form.
