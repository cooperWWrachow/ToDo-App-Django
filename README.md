In order to further understand Django, HTML, and CSS, I decided to ditch my daily sticky notes and create a task list app that 
I can use on a daily basis. It may not be the most complicated project, but it aided in my understanding of front-end development alongside Django's backend functionality.
I decided not to deploy it as a full website, but instead created a batch file that runs the "manage.py runserver" command on the startup of my desktop. Below are a few GIFs
that demonstrate its functionality!

First, I wanted to show its login/logout/user registration functionality. While, I am the only person using the app, I still wanted to develop an appealing login and user registration page.
The first GIF shows the login form, while the second shows the registration form.

As for the actual task list, I provided a quick GIF to demonstrate adding a task. As you can see, the tasks due on the current date are highlighted green and 
the count is adjusted. Simple grammar changes in the functionality exist (i.e., "Tasks Due Today: 2" vs "Task Due Today: 1"). The logo brings you back to the home page.
Clicking the red X allows immediate deletion of tasks. The limit to displayed tasks is set to 5. Lastly, just for fun, a welcome prompt exists in the navbar for the logged in user:)
